#     nosing: "Golden sultanas, overripe pineapple, rum, liquorice, beeswax, jasmine tea, white pepper, cinnamon, leather, oak."
#     sipping: "Full and mouth-coating, malty-sweet, with a distinct bitterness that’s typical of Linkwood. Orange marmalade, dried mulberries and gooseberries. Not overly complex, but delicious. Longish finish with gooseberry and tropical fruit"
