## Professional activities

*2024 and forward*  
**Co-organizer & Lecturer: "INTP Spring/Summer School on Mathematical Theory in Community Ecology"**, Surba, France  
This school, initiated and hosted by the *Institut Natura e Teoria Pirenèus (INTP)*, offers an overview of community ecology for interdisciplinary theoreticians from Master's level and up. The lecture materials have been crafted in a collaborative fashion by our team of researchers working on both sides of the interface between physics and community ecology, with the aim to unify and synthesizing perspectives. The first edition of the school was held in May 2025 ([programme](https://intp.science/en/content/2025-intp-spring-school-community-ecology)) with the second edition planned for July 2026.

*July 2023*  
**Principal organizer: 'Microbial community ecology: bridging theory and observations'**, MPI Plön, Germany  
The aim of this 3-day workshop was to tackle the high complexity of diverse microbial ecosystems through integration of insights from across different perspectives and methodologies ((programme)[https://workshops.evolbio.mpg.de/event/84/overview]). Organized by myself, Silvia De Monte, and several international peers for 40 attending scientists, my responsibilities included setting the scientific agenda, budgeting, inviting/selecting participants, and moderating talk sessions.

*2020 - 2021*  
**Co-organizer & Host: "Statistical Physics and Complexity Webinar Series"**
